EventLitez!
Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the completion of my beginner-friendly project, EventLitez, which is a simple yet functional event listing website. Developed using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, this project serves as an excellent introduction to front-end web development.

Key Features:
Event Creation: Users can easily create events by filling out a form with essential details like event name, date, time, and location.
Event Listing: The website showcases a clean and organized list of upcoming events, allowing users to view all necessary information at a glance.
This project has been a fantastic opportunity for me to enhance my skills in web development and gain practical experience in creating user-friendly interfaces. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and exploring more advanced features in future projects!
